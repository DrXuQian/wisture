This repository contains the open-source code related to the work reported by the paper by M.Haseeb and R.Parasuraman, "Wisture: RNN-based Learning of Wireless Signals for Gesture Recognition in Unmodified Smartphones", submitted to the Journal of Special Topics in Signal Processing.
# Wisture
Wisture is a machine lerning (LSTM-RNN) and custom signal processing based solution for recognizing over-the-air hand gestures using Wi-Fi Received Signal Strength on unmodified smartphones (without requiring changes to existing hardware and software/OS of the phone).

# Winiff
As a part of Wisture, we developed an Android app called "Winiff" (available in Google Playstore). Using Winiff, one can record high-frequency Wi-Fi RSS values and save them to text files (the app provide means for exporting the saved RSSI files).  The app uses an artificaial traffic induction (between the phone and the Wi-Fi access point (AP)) approach to enable useful and meaningful Radio Signal Strength values.
